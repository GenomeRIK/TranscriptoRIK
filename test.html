<h1>Getting started with TAMA Collapse</h1>
<p>TAMA Collapse is a tool used primarily to remove redundant transcript models from long read transcript sequencing read mapping files.</p>

<p>
The input for TAMA Collapse is a BAM/SAM file generated by mapping long read transcript sequencing data onto a genome assembly. 
The BAM/SAM file must be sorted first which can be done using Samtools. 

You can find a demo SAM file in the TAMA reopository here:
[test.sam](https://github.com/GenomeRIK/tama/blob/master/test_files/gmap_test.sam)
